The data was collected over a period of time, and the analysis provides various key metrics and visualizations to understand the company's sales performance and customer behavior.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Power BI
- Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data from Adventure Works. It includes information about sales orders, customer details, product information, order dates, and other relevant attributes required for the analysis.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Analyze weekly revenue, profit, and return rate orders.

## DAX Commands

Throughout the project, the following DAX commands were used to perform calculations and derive meaningful insights:

1. `CALCULATE`: Used to modify or filter the context of a calculation.
2. `SUMX`: Used to calculate a sum over a table, applying an expression to each row.
3. `COUNTROWS`: Used to count the number of rows in a table.
4. `FILTER`: Used to filter a table or expression, based on specific conditions.
5. `RANKX`: Used to rank items based on a specified expression.
6. `RELATED`: Used to retrieve related values from another table.
